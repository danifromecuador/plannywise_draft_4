<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## 💻 Getting Started <a name="getting-started"></a>

> Would you like to make use of this project?

To get a local copy up and running, follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

First Make sure YOu have installed

- [git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [node](https://nodejs.org/en)
- A code editor, the most used is [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) but you can chose any other.

**We do recommend to work on linux**

### Setup

Open you desired folder within you terminal:

```sh
  cd my-folder
```
Then clone the project repository in you current folder

```sh
  git clone git@github.com:Diegogagan2587/Book-a-concert-front-end.git
```

### Install

to install project follow next steps:
 
 1. Open the project folder

```sh
  cd Book-a-concert-front-end
```
2. then install require dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

3. As the last step, you'll need to create a `.env` file in the
root folder of the project as shown below:
```.env
  //.env

  VITE_API_URL_BASE='http://127.0.0.1:3001'
```
Note: Please make sure that VITE_API_URL_BASE correspond to your desired API base, in this case we are assuming that you have already installed and running the Rails API in local on your computer, if you don't, get it here: 
[Book A Concert - Back End](https://github.com/Diegogagan2587/Book-a-concert-back-end).

Everything should be ready now!

### Usage

To run the project, execute the following command:

```sh
  npm run dev
```

### Run tests

We have implemented test using Vitest, React Testing Library and MSW for mocking
responses from the API. If you would like replicate the settings for our test please refer to 
[Introduction To React Testing](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-react-new-introduction-to-react-testing) 
from [The Oding Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/);

To run tests, run the following command:

```sh
  npm run test
```

### Deployment

You can deploy locally this project using:

```sh
npm run build
```
Don't forget to set up you environmental variables in production:

- `API_URL_BASE = your_api_base_url_here`

<!-- CONTRIBUTING -->

## 🤝 Contributing <a name="contributing"></a>

Contributions, issues, and feature requests are welcome!

Feel free to check the [issues page](https://github.com/Diegogagan2587/Book-a-concert-front-end/issues).

### Naming branches conventions

Before submitting a pull request please read the original article we based our naming branching conventions [Naming conventions for Git Branches - a Cheatsheet](https://medium.com/@abhay.pixolo/naming-conventions-for-git-branches-a-cheatsheet-8549feca2534) by [Abhay Amin in medium](https://medium.com/@abhay.pixolo). Check some examples with prefixes below:

- `feat/branch-name` branches that implement a new feature or enhancement
- `fix/branch-name` branches that fix a bug
- `docs/branch-name` branches that works on documentation

We are open to other prefixes as long as they are clear and follow general branching conventions. also please note that expect you to submit pull requests from feature branches.

### Commit Conventions

Stick to conventions can bring benefits like better clarity in code reviews, we strive to use the following prefixes in our commits:
- `feat/element` when new functionality is added.
- `fix/element` when a bug on `element` is fixed.
- `chore/` daily task not related to features of errors, like adding elements to `.gitignore` or installing a dependency.
- `test/` if we add or fix a test.
- `docs/` when only documentation is updated.
- `build/` when the change affects only compilation of the project.
- `ci/` Changes that affect continuous integration.
- `style/` Changes that affect code formatting and does not affect functionality.
- `perf/` Changes that affect performance.
- `revert` Automatically implemented by git, but it is used for changes that revert a commit.

### What we value from pull request

We appreciate clean contributions, that highlights main changes, if you plan to format the file, might be good idea to do it in another pull request to make changes that affect functionality easier to read by separate them from those than only affect formatting.
